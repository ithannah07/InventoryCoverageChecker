# InventoryCoverageChecker

The program reads two files and stores their contents in arrayA and arrayB. The first number in each file indicates the array size, and the remaining numbers are the contents. It then checks if all the numbers in arrayA appear in arrayB, accounting for duplicates. If any numbers in arrayA are missing or the duplicates don’t match, the program outputs “does not satisfy.” Otherwise, it prints “satisfies.”
